# Problem 04

## Description

As a user, I want to be able to locate an existing contact in a list using the partial or full number.

Write a program that finds the number P in the list of numbers B with length N and returns the name of contact A.

- A - List of names (max. 10 chars per name)
- B - List of phone numbers
- N - Length of list
- P - Number to be found

If the number is not on the list, return "NO CONTACT"
