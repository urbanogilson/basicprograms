## Description

Write a hash table in C

Inspired by: https://github.com/jamesroutley/write-a-hash-table

'In computing, a hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.'ยน.
