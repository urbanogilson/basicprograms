# Problem 01

## Description

Write a program that prints the endianness of the computer.

'In computing, endianness is the order or sequence of bytes of a word of digital data in computer memory.
Endianness is primarily expressed as big-endian (BE) or little-endian (LE).
A big-endian system stores the most significant byte of a word at the smallest memory address and the least significant byte at the largest.
A little-endian system, in contrast, stores the least-significant byte at the smallest address.'ยน.
